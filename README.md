# React Weather App - ReactJS Projects

## Overview
This project is a weather application built using ReactJS and CSS for styling. The main objective of this project was to deepen my understanding of API integration by utilizing the OpenWeather API. The application allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city worldwide, displaying the temperature of the location that was searched.  By working on this project, I aimed to enhance my skills in handling API calls, managing state in React, and styling components using CSS.

## Features
- Search Functionality: Users can enter a city name to get the current weather data for that location.
- Real-Time Data: The application fetches data from the OpenWeather API to provide up-to-date weather information.
